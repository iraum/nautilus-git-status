# nautilus-git-status

A small Nautilus extension that surfaces git status in three places,
all driven by the same data:

- **Emblems** — a single combined indicator composited onto the
  folder icon for every git repo, updated live. Encodes both **status**
  (outer disk color) and **ownership tier** (small inner dot color).
- **Right-click menu** — a `Git — <state>` submenu with the
  one-line headline plus the full breakdown.
- **Properties → Git tab** — the same breakdown rendered as a
  Properties dialog page with selectable text.

Emblems sit on top of whatever icon a folder already has, including
the custom-icon PNGs produced by the companion
[`nautilus-folder-icons`](https://github.com/iraum/nautilus-folder-icons)
script — use either alone or stack them.

## What it shows

Every git repo root gets exactly **one** emblem with two layers:

**Outer disk — status.** Fills the emblem with the status color; when
several states are true at once, the most actionable one wins (dirty
beats behind beats ahead).

| Color   | Meaning                                            |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| orange  | Working tree has uncommitted / unstaged changes.   |
| red     | Upstream has commits not in local branch.          |
| green   | Local branch has commits not in upstream.          |
| white   | Repo is in sync with upstream, working tree clean. |

**Inner dot — ownership tier.** A small black-outlined dot in the
center of the status disk identifies which of your git profiles the
repo belongs to. The status color stays visible as a ring around it.
Tier is resolved (in order) from the owner slug in `git remote get-url
origin`, then `git config user.name`, then `git config user.email`.
The mapping resolves system → user: a shared base in
`/etc/nautilus-git-status/profiles.conf` (seeded by a system-wide
install), overlaid by a per-account
`~/.config/nautilus-git-status/profiles.conf` if one exists
(see [Configuring ownership](#configuring-ownership)).

| Center dot | Tier      | What it means                                     |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| gold       | primary   | Your main profile — repos you own.                |
| cyan       | secondary | Your second profile.                              |
| purple     | tertiary  | Your third profile.                               |
| (none)     | external  | Doesn't match any of your profiles — plain status disk only. |

**No-remote signal.** When a tiered repo has no remote configured
(`git remote` returns nothing), the inner dot's outline switches to a
bolder crimson stroke instead of the normal soft black. This flags
repos that exist purely on your machine — owned but not pushed
anywhere yet — without changing the tier color. External repos don't
participate in this signal: they have no inner dot to outline.

So a green disk with a gold center means "ahead under primary" — your
main profile has unpushed commits. The same gold center with a red
outline means "this is yours, primary tier, and there's no remote at
all". A plain white disk (no center dot) is a clean third-party clone.

Emblems update live: each repo's `.git/` directory is watched via
`Gio.FileMonitor`, so commits, stages, fetches, and branch switches
trigger a re-render within a fraction of a second. The config file is
watched too — edit it and the emblems re-tier without restarting
Nautilus. No polling, no systemd timer.

## Configuring ownership

`install.sh` seeds a `profiles.conf` on first run — in
`~/.config/nautilus-git-status/` for a per-user install, or
`/etc/nautilus-git-status/` for a system-wide one. Format is one line
per tier:

```ini
# Comma-separated identifiers per tier. Matched case-insensitively
# against the origin owner slug, then user.name, then user.email.
primary   = iraum, iraumbo@gmail.com
secondary = x42i
tertiary  = iraum-oracle
```

Anything not listed is rendered as `external`. Save the file and
emblems repaint within a fraction of a second; no restart needed.

**Resolution is system → user.** The extension reads
`/etc/nautilus-git-status/profiles.conf` first as a shared base, then
overlays `~/.config/nautilus-git-status/profiles.conf` per-identifier
if it exists. So one system-wide config gives every account the same
map, and any single account can override or extend it by dropping in
its own file. Both paths are watched, so editing either repaints live.

## Right-click menu

Right-click any repo folder → top-level **Git — <state>** item. The
label is a one-line headline:

- `Git — clean (main)`
- `Git — dirty — 5 changes (main)`
- `Git — ↑2 ahead (main)`
- `Git — ↓3 behind (main)`

Hover the item to open a submenu with the full breakdown — branch,
upstream tracking with ahead/behind, status counts, origin URL, and
last commit. Same data as the Properties → Git tab; one less click
to get there.

## Properties → Git tab

Right-click any repo folder → **Properties** → **Git** tab. Shows:

- **Status** — clean / dirty (with staged / modified / untracked /
  unmerged counts) / ahead / behind.
- **Identity** — the slug used to assign the tier and the resulting
  tier name (e.g. `iraum (primary)` or `some-org (external)`). When
  the repo has no remote, `, no remote` is appended.
- **Branch** — current branch name (or `(detached)`).
- **Upstream** — tracked remote branch with ahead/behind counts.
- **Origin** — `origin` remote URL.
- **Last commit** — subject line and relative time.

The text is selectable, so you can copy any of it.

## Install

```bash
# 1. Install the Nautilus Python binding (one-time, system-wide)
sudo dnf install -y nautilus-python   # needs ol9_developer_EPEL enabled

# 2. Drop the extension and emblem icons in place
./install.sh
```

The per-user installer copies:

- `nautilus-git-status.py` → `~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/`
- `icons/emblem-git-*.svg` → `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/emblems/`
  (28 emblems: 4 statuses × 3 tiers × 2 remote-states + 4 statuses × external)
- A starter `profiles.conf` → `~/.config/nautilus-git-status/`,
  but only if no config exists already (it never overwrites yours).

…then refreshes the GTK icon cache and restarts Nautilus if it's
already running. Re-run the installer any time you edit
`icons/generate.py` to regenerate the SVGs first
(`python3 icons/generate.py`).

### System-wide install (shared by every account)

On a multi-account machine, install once as root so all users share one
copy of the extension and one ownership map:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y nautilus-python   # if not already present
sudo ./install.sh                     # --system is implied when run as root
```

System mode targets:

- `nautilus-git-status.py` → `/usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/`
- `icons/emblem-git-*.svg` → `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/emblems/`
- A starter `profiles.conf` → `/etc/nautilus-git-status/` (seeded only if
  absent), which becomes the shared base every account reads.

It refreshes the system icon cache but does **not** restart anyone's
Nautilus — that would disrupt other users' sessions. Each logged-in user
reloads to pick up the extension:

```bash
nautilus -q
# if the surface doesn't appear (gapplication-service keeps the old
# process alive): pkill -u $USER nautilus && sleep 1 && nautilus &
```

Any account can still override the shared map by creating its own
`~/.config/nautilus-git-status/profiles.conf` (see
[Configuring ownership](#configuring-ownership)).

## Migrating from git-emblems

If you previously installed the `git-emblems` extension (when this
project lived inside `nautilus-folder-icons/git-emblems/`), one-time
migration:

```bash
mv ~/.config/nautilus-folder-icons ~/.config/nautilus-git-status
mv ~/.config/nautilus-git-status/git-emblems.conf \
   ~/.config/nautilus-git-status/profiles.conf
```

Then run `./install.sh`. The installer removes the old
`~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/git-emblems.py` for you.
The old `~/.config/nautilus-folder-icons/` directory only existed
to host this config — moving it is safe.

## How it works

Nautilus calls `update_file_info()` on every visible folder. The
extension:

1. Skips anything that isn't a local directory containing a `.git`
   (directory or file — worktrees and submodules count).
2. On a cache miss, runs `git status --porcelain=v2 --branch`
   synchronously (1-second timeout) and stores the resulting emblem.
   `git status` on a healthy repo is fast — tens of milliseconds —
   so the first render of a parent dir with N repos costs ~N quick
   git invocations. Subsequent renders are cache hits.
3. Sets up a `Gio.FileMonitor` on `.git/`, `.git/refs/heads`, and
   `.git/refs/remotes`. Any change drops the cache entry and calls
   `invalidate_extension_info()` so Nautilus re-renders.

The right-click menu and the Properties → Git tab are separate
interfaces on the same class — `Nautilus.MenuProvider` and
`Nautilus.PropertyPageProvider` respectively. Both run their own
`git status` / `git log` / `git remote` calls fresh at the moment
of interaction (right-click or dialog open), independent of the
emblem cache. Cheap at human-scale interaction rates and avoids any
staleness concerns.

## Notes / limits

- Only marks the **repo root** (the folder containing a `.git`
  directory or file). Nested folders inside a repo are left alone.
- "Behind" only updates when something local actually fetches —
  Nautilus is not going to run `git fetch` for you. Pair with a
  separate periodic fetcher (e.g., a systemd user timer) if you want
  upstream changes reflected without manual fetches.
- Emblems are a Nautilus concept — they don't appear in
  file-picker dialogs from other apps.
- Verified on Oracle Linux 9 with Nautilus 40 (`libnautilus-extension`
  API 3.0) and `nautilus-python` 1.2.3.
- **After install/upgrade, Nautilus must reload extensions.** The
  installer runs `nautilus -q`, which is enough on most setups. With
  `--gapplication-service` (the modern default) an active window can
  keep the process alive — if the new surface doesn't appear, force
  a fresh process:

  ```bash
  pkill -u $USER nautilus && sleep 1 && nautilus &
  ```

## Uninstall

Per-user:

```bash
rm ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/nautilus-git-status.py
rm ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/emblems/emblem-git-*.svg
rm -rf ~/.config/nautilus-git-status      # only if you also want to drop the config
gtk-update-icon-cache -f ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor
nautilus -q
```

System-wide (as root):

```bash
sudo rm /usr/share/nautilus-python/extensions/nautilus-git-status.py
sudo rm /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/emblems/emblem-git-*.svg
sudo rm -rf /etc/nautilus-git-status      # only if you also want to drop the config
sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor
# each user: nautilus -q
```
